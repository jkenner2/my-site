        <p>
          For farmers who need a better way to manage their cattle, Cattle Cloud is a web application that stores everything about the health and well-being of their cattle all in place. Unlike the old fashion way of recording cattle information in binders, our product allows users to get a quick overview of their farm on our dashboard, and they can generate reports and reminders.
        </p>
        <h2>Idea 2</h2>
        <p>
          For bars and nightclubs that need enhanced bouncer security, Required is a web application that uses a smartphone to scan and record photo ids of customers at the door. Unlike having a bouncer let people in by memory, our product records each ID into our dataset to prevent idâ€™s from being used twice and those who have caused trouble before from being let back in.
        </p>
        <h2>Idea 3</h2>
        <p>
          For detailing companies that are looking to make getting a quote easier, Sparkle is a web application that allows customers to make their quotes and schedule an appointment. Unlike having prices listed on a web page, our product is interactive and time-saving.
